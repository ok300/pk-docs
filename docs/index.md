# Pubky SDK

Pubky is an open protocol for per-public-key backends for censorship resistant web applications. It combines PKARR (a censorship resistant public-key based alternative to DNS) with conventional web technologies to keep users in control of their identities and data.

## Key Features

- **Public key based authentication**: Users authenticate using their keypairs
- **Key-value storage**: Store and retrieve data through PUT/GET/DELETE HTTP operations
- **Decentralized**: Data is stored on homeservers but indexed via PKARR
- **Censorship resistant**: Built on top of DHT and PKARR for resilience
