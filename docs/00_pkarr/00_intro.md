#PKARR

PKARR is a protocol for decentralized, DNS-like name resolution using public-key cryptography and a distributed hash table (DHT).

It allows users to associate DNS resource records (such as A, AAAA, or TXT) with cryptographic public keys, enabling secure, censorship-resistant mapping of names to data.

A PKARR client can publish, update, and resolve these signed records within the DHT, providing lookup and publishing capabilities for PKARR/PKDNS records.
